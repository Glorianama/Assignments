###Introduction
___
Over the last years, it is apparent that women have increasingly managed to both enter in traditional male occupations[1] and increase their participation in the labour force and, subsequently, to the labour market. As a result, over the last years the gender pay gap has diminished significantly, especially during 1985 – 2000 (Blau F. and Kahn L., 2000).

Nonetheless, even after this considerable convergence between the wages of men and women the ratio in Figure 1 moves closer to 100%), the gender wage gap still remains a persistent global phenomenon. In addition, the relevant economic literature, based on the concurrent evidence, has highlighted that the pace of reduction of the gender wage gap has slowed down and its narrowing is not likely to continue in the future[2]. Especially, after the impact of the 2008 financial crisis which destabilized labour markets and the generally economy. Thus, the persistent and distortive nature of the gender wage gap requires active policies and positive measures in order to enhance pay equity. However, in order to construct feasible and efficient policies, initially the sources and the reasons of the specific problem should be explored.

Before we proceed with the presentation of gender pay gap causes, some economic terms have to be clarified by providing a few brief definitions. First, the gender wage gap (or gender pay gap) is a measure the earnings differences between women and men in paid employment in the labour market. It is one of the many indicators of gender inequality in a country, when examining labour market participation in terms of gender (Education International, 2005, pp. 1). Secondly, the labour market refers to the supply and demand for labor, in which employees provide the supply and employers the demand. It is a major component of any economy, and is intricately tied in with markets for capital, goods and services[3] . Namely, demand for labor is a concept that describes the amount of demand for labor that an economy or firm is willing to employ at a given point in time while, the labour supply is the number of hours people are willing and able to supply at a given wage rate. Finally, labor force is the number of individuals in an economy who either are employed or are seeking employment.

###Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Segregation (Social Norms Perspective)
___

The hitherto economic literature, in general, has identified two main reasons which contribute to the gender wage gap. The first one is the direct gender discrimination in the labour market and the second one is occupational (gender) segregation. In this chapter, our analysis will concentrate exclusively on the occupational segregation. Before, we proceed with the demonstration of the correlation between the gender wage gap and the occupational segregation; we have initially to provide a brief description of the latter term. ‘Occupational or employment segregation’[4] is an expression for the gendered division of labour in paid employment, where men and women are channeled into different types of occupational roles and tasks. Occupational segregations could vary by race, gender, generational cohorts (different generations of women which insert in the labour market) educational background and skill requirements. 

The economic literature broadly covers most of the factors that could possibly affect the gender wage gap and has concluded that indeed the occupational segregation constitutes a major contributor to that specific gap. Moreover, a careful look at the occupational segregation and gender earnings ratio implies that these two trends have an inverse correlation. The following graph is intuitive to fathom that kind of relation.

___

Hence, as the Index of Occupational Segregation diminishes and approaches zero (the labour market becomes more occupationally integrated), the relative earnings of women with respect to their male counterparts increase.

Based on the hitherto literature analysis, it is apparent that the occupational segregation affects negatively the earnings of genders since it splits the labour market to predominantly male and female occupations. Moreover, females face a wage penalty as female occupations usually are paid less. The term wage penalty means that female workers earn less money than their counterparts in jobs that require the exact same skills and responsibilities. Figures 3 and Figure 4 show a group of selected occupations and the proportion of women that work in them. As it can be seen in Figure 4, women’s wages in male-dominated occupations are particular low compared to their male counterparts, but also for female-dominated jobs the wage gap still exists.

The aforementioned information is related with the part of the literature that tries to establish the occupational segregation with respect to various observable aspects that are related with the skills, educational level and preferences of women in the labour market. However, some studies have underlined that “there is an unexplained residual which reflects gender discrimination” (Educational International. pp. 6). Therefore, occupational segregation has to be examined under the spectrum of social norms or attitudes[5]. Social norms can have such a powerful effect, that they may increase segregation and impact negatively the gender wage gap.

The first observed social norm that preserves this gender bias is connected with the motherhood of women. In particular, from their family environment girls are being taught that their duties are inextricably connected with taking care of the children. Moreover, this specific social norm not only affects the behavior of women, by leading them to search primarily for part-time jobs when there are parental duties, but also affects the education system and the basic public labour authorities. The latter is reflected by the general channeling of women to relevant working areas with child care and children in general. Due to the above, gender integration is hindered across occupations and this ends up to a fundamental undervaluation of women’s work.

Secondly, employers are affected by the specific social norm and, respectively, adjust their behavior towards to female workers. More specifically, women are often considered as “potential mothers” who will plausibly interrupt their careers. As consequence, employers tend to give lower wages to female workers (both full-time and part-time) and in the same time they may not provide promotion opportunities[6]. Therefore, it is profound how a social norm can contribute to the employers’ behavior and subsequently how that norm could create a norm of undervaluation of women’s work at the labour market and extensively to the whole society.

###Feasible-potential tools-policies to reduce the occupational segregation
___

From the above description, it can be perceived that occupational segregation (from social norms’ channel or not) is positively related with gender wage gap. This relationship suggests that occupational segregation should continue to be the target of any policy effort to tackle the wage gap (Hegewisch A. and Hartmann H. 2014). However, the literature underlines that the various forms of occupational segregation are vague and this sector demands prudent actions (Educational International, 2005).

The economic literature provides various potential policies to integrate occupations in the labor market. At first, there are policies that target improving the earnings of female-dominated jobs. For instance, a (higher) minimum wage can be imposed to in female-dominated jobs or more adequate parental leave policies[7]. Furthermore, paid sick days can be adopted in order to improve the job quality of females (Hegewisch A. and Hartmann H. 2014).

Secondly, in order to augment occupational integration the policy-makers have to incentivize private employers to redress pay inequalities and change their practices. This can be achieved either by imposing equal pay legislation or by assigning them to attend various workshops and seminars[8] to improve the generalperception of the actual value of women’s work. For instance, employers are more likely to reduce the barriers provide equal opportunities by adapting the work environment to suit in both genders[9]. 

To sum up, the contemporary economic literature provides tools which are able to enhance occupational integration (either by the perspective of social norms or not) and subsequently, reduce the gender wage gap by leading the society to realize the actual value of women’s work and emphasizing on gender equality[10].

###Direct Gender Discrimination
___

As mentioned above, the research suggests us that two factors contribute most to the existence of the gender gap and on its persistence: the occupational segregation, described in the previous chapter, and the direct gender discrimination in the labor market.

From recent studies it is known that the latter is a phenomenon that involves nearly all the occupational fields (Hegewisch & Hartmann, 2014) and has to deal with implicit social norms. These social norms address and prescribe the employers to set a wage scheme which is consistent with a positive and persistent gender wage gap. The literature defines it as a situation that occurs when two equally productive individuals, working under the same conditions, are rewarded differently in terms of their wages.

Before analyzing further considerations, it is important to clarify two key concepts. First of all, the term productivity is referred, in economy, as an indicator that expresses how many units of output are produced with a unit of input, (for instance: how many users are served at the post office in a man-hour or how many procedures are finalized in a day at the Municipality of Tilburg Offices). However, this statement has to be considered carefully, because it may not be a good indicator of the quality required from the nature of the employment or can even be too hard to determine with enough precision. Secondly, for the same working conditions it is necessary to explicitly mention the cases in which both individuals do the same job, or do similar jobs that demand the same requirements.

From the definition that is being considered in this case, discrimination appears exclusively in terms of wages. That is, even when taking out the differences related to the nature of the job, its requirements, the necessary skills, and all the other characteristics, also related to the workers, male wages are higher than women’s ones. This result is a solid finding from the research. From a theoretical point of view, a wagede-composition approach is usually used, as it allows to measure the amount of direct discrimination in wages in a given field or sector. This methodology describes the existence of an explained gap in wage, which is built by collecting the differences in observable characteristics linked to both the job and the employee (for instance: economic sector, how many years of occupation in the same sector, college major, GPA, hours worked, etc.), and un unexplained gap, which is commonly interpreted as an estimate of the discrimination on women’s earnings.

In order to provide a better idea of the concept of discrimination and of its extent, some of the most important findings by the American Association of University Women (2006) will be mentioned. The Association’s main goal was to photograph the situation in America of the gender pay gap, and its evolution over the time.

* Discrimination has decreased in the last decades, however it remains consistent in its extent and is persistent in time.
* The gap exists in nearly all the occupations for which the authors collected data.
* Male-dominated jobs tend to have higher wages compared to female-dominated occupations.
* An increase in the number of female workers in traditionally male-dominated jobs tend to reduce the average wage for that occupation, even if women benefit from a rise in their salary (the gap does not disappear, but occupational segregation decreases.)
* Women are underrepresented in most of the high-paying jobs and even in those occupational field in which they are overrepresented in terms of workforce, they are less likely to be hired for higher positions within the same sector.
* After carrying out a wage decomposition analysis, there is a 7% gap between the earnings, in the year after graduation, of male with respect to women, (it jumps to 12% after 10 years from the graduation) that couldn’t be justified by any statistical reason.

From a policy perspective, some simple actions can be taken in order to reduce the level of discrimination in the labor market. For instance, the US Office of Personnel Management makes public the salaries and range of wages for each level of the Federal workers, and also provides additional information regarding the areas in which the cost of living is particularly high. This policy has helped reduce the gap close to zero and contributes to create a fairer working environment. Given that in many situations women are discouraged, or even explicitly forbidden, to discuss salary rises, Hill (2011) observed that this situation occurs less frequently in the public sector (14% reported by interviewed) with respect to the private sector (61%).

Moreover, the White House Equal Pay Pledge (2009), announced and signed by the President Obama administration (now a law), forces the employers of the private sector companies to commit to guarantee an equal pay for their employees. It has been signed and adopted by many big companies such as Facebook, American Airlines, General Motors and Apple.

As it has been mentioned before, the differences in wages between men and women lead to undesired outcomes. These differentials may arise in three possible situations: women generally earn less than men, women earn less than men in the same occupation or women earn less than men for jobs that have the same requirements. All three scenarios are particularly important as they clearly exemplify a source of discrimination. In previous decades, when each gender had its role in society, employers would statistically discriminate their employees (Bielby and Baron, 1986). Statistical discrimination implies that employers would simply assume that all women were, on average, the same. The latter lead to occupational segregation, meaning that some occupations were mainly carried out by women, while others were done predominantly by men (Hegewisch et al., 2010).

As the differences in education level out and more women complete higher (tertiary) education (Figure 5), it is surprising that the earnings gap still exists. It is true that the wage gap has decreased in the past years, however, there are still occupations in which women are underrepresented (especially those jobs with higher wages). Given that social and education patterns have changed; it is still hard to justify the use of statistical discrimination by employers. Thus, the segregation in occupations may be due to the imposition of entry barriers for women (Levine, 2004), which is not so easy to overcome. If employers have certain degree of rejection towards women (say, taste-based discrimination), the educational gains that women have achieved and their new career perspectives will not be enough to reach a wage ratio equal to 1. Taste-based discrimination arises when the employer does not like women and feels that (s)he is paying more to his/her female employers than what (s)he is actually paying. In this case, the wage premium that men perceive is justified by the feeling that women are getting a higher wage compared to what they are actually receiving.

So, if employers discriminate based on their dislike for women, is this strategy optimal? Is discrimination a good decision from the companies’ point of view? According to Noland et al. (2016), the inclusion of women in higher positions increases the firm’s performance and skill base, giving room for further growth. Moreover, Weber and Zulehner (2009) carried out an analysis of startups survival rates based on the share of female employees. Their results show that firms that discriminate (have lower a percentage of women in their workforce compared to the industry average), tend to have lower survival rates. It is hard, if not impossible, to find an objective reason that would justify that women are kept out of certain occupations, especially those that have the higher wages. Furthermore, from a theoretical point of view it is not possible to justify the differences in wages.

The introduction of public policies is a possible solution to the gender-based discrimination in the labor market. Some proponents state that the use of comparable worth policies should be a good start. Comparable worth implies that people doing equivalent jobs (have the same requirements, responsibilities, and attributes) should receive the same wage (Levine, 2004). Although in theory it is a good idea, the implementation and assumptions behind are hard and unpractical. Another policy tool can be the use of shared jobs.

###Policy Analysis, Quotas
___
By definition, a quota is a fixed number or percentage of minority group members needed to meet the requirements of affirmative action. In the context of gender inequality in the labour markets, it simply implies that a fixed percentage of job-positions being reserved for women. This leads to the question, why are quotas necessary? Argumentatively, the answer is quite simple – it is an effort to reduce discrimination faced by women in the workplace. As mentioned earlier women all around the world face a variety of issues in the workplace, ranging from unequal pay to sexual harassment. Imposition of quotas seeks to alleviate or reduce the effect of these issues by improving the representation of women in the workplace.

A recent body of work seems to suggest that women often seek to opt out of competition in the workplace or at the very least, are more competition ‘averse’ than men (Niederly and Gneezy 2003) Note, that this holds for women having the similar levels of skill and experience as their male counterparts. Now, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is debatable – though it has been argued that this aversion to competition may be a result of discriminatory practices that have long plagued our labour markets.

The above-mentioned issue highlights the need for affirmative action on the part of governments and policy makers to reduce gender discrimination in the workplace. For governments and policy makers, there exist several ‘tools’ that can be used to made use of to reduce discrimination, in the context of firms and political organizations. Of course, this is not just limited to these two scenarios, but this provides a reasonable starting point.

Out of the three most commonly used ‘tools’ - quotas, preferential treatment and ‘competition repetition’ - it has been shown that quotas are indeed the most effective and do not have negative consequences as far as other workers in the firm are concerned, thereby making them good policy prescriptions (Balafoutas and Sutter, 2010). However, there does exist a potential caveat – economic experiments that seek to replicate real-life scenarios may not always reflect what works in actual practice. This is not the result of any underlying ‘flaw’ in the experiment itself, but rather the fact that workplace related scenarios are often highly nuanced and it is not possible to capture these specific details in a single experiment.

Given the nature of societal problem like gender discrimination, it is also necessary to approach it from a moral/ethical perspective. For governments and policy makers alike, there exist two forms of affirmative action, based on how a given action/policy affects the outcome (in this case, gender discrimination).

From the policy-makers’ perspective, there are two possible arguments that serve as a form of reasoning to alleviate inequality and discrimination:

* Ensuring equality of outcome – In such an argument, the primary objective of the policy maker is to ensure that all the involved groups end up with equal outcomes. This is a sort of ‘last-stage’ policy where the target variable, so to say is directly sought to be changed. The underlying causes and mechanism that lead to inequality in such a policy decision are often ignored, often in the interest of feasibility and time.

* Ensuring equality of opportunity – This form of reasoning, on the other hand seeks to treat the underlying mechanism that leads to inequality in the first place. The primary objective in a nutshell, is to induce a sort of level-playing field upon which (equal) individuals compete to produce optimal outcome. This resonates closely to the idea of ‘laissez-faire’ wherein the underlying issue cause of inequality is treated, rather than the outcome. For the given context of gender discrimination, the use of quotas is an example of a policy which seeks to equalize the outcome - the lack of female labour force participation and gender based discrimination in the workplace. On the other hand, a corresponding policy that seeks to equalize outcomes in the scenario would be, say, a policy which seeks to reverse the societal norms that discriminate against women.

Traditionally, it has been the view that equalizing opportunities is preferable to equalizing outcomes, purely because it implies that the underlying causes of inequality are also treated (Roemer and Trannoy 2013) This is particularly true as far as law and policy makers are concerned (Arneson 2015). However, as Phillips (2005) mentions, the very reason that one might try and balance outcomes is the fact that opportunities are in fact not equal and to change them by way of policy is beyond the bounds of possibility. 

For the purpose of examining the consequences of quotas in real life scenarios, we take into account two scenarios where quotas have often been implemented – politics and private corporations.

1) Political leadership – The UN-led Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace, 15 September 1995 argued for quota policies by calling for all international governments to “ensure equal representation of women at all decision-making levels in national and international institutions.” This set up a precedent for several federal governments across the world. In the form of both voluntary and compulsory quotas, governments across the world started to increase female representation in the sphere of politics. 

While quotas do not have any immediate consequences in the form of equalizing outcomes, it has been shown that they lead to improved attitudes of both political leaders and voters in ways that can reduce the need for such quotas in the long run (Ford and Pande 2011).

2) Corporate board leadership - The idea of having quotas for women in the corporate workplace is relatively novel, especially when compared to the political sphere. Nevertheless, there does exist substantial amount of literature on quotas that have been implemented in corporate boards across countries. Norway, Spain and Germany are examples of countries that have successfully added mandates for gender based quotas. Responses have been overwhelmingly positive as far as participation is concerned. This leads to conclude that there is no unwillingness on the part of women to work in positions of leadership. Moreover, it has been shown that there are no adverse effects of having women as decision makers in corporate organizations. On the contrary, the evidence seems the suggest that it actually leads to better short-term outcomes for workers (Ford and Pande 2011).

Conclusion

Despite the fact that women made huge gains in their educational attainment and have massively joined the workforce over the last several decades, they are still paid less than men. There is good evidence that discrimination contributes to the persistent pay disparity between men and women.

From the above presentation, it is profound that approaching an equal pay between both genders will benefit the society. The aforementioned assertion has been tested by the economic literature. In particular, Costa J. and Siva E. in 2008 had constructed an economic model which predicts that by diminishing gender wage gap and increasing participation of women in the labour market, will probably lead to improved economic growth, alleviation of poverty, reduction of inequality and various beneficial results for both genders, regardless their age (Education International, 2005). Furthermore, studies have shown that even if occupational integration had been achieved, the gender gap would still exist due to the consistent and persistence evidence we got from the existence of the unexplained gap. The analysis has proved that this persistent discrimination it’s irrational, because gender equality achieves higher profits and better work environments. Finally, considering the perspectives about the gender gap, it can be mentioned that there is
still plenty area which require policy implementation and investigation by the corresponding literature in order to ameliorate further the specific phenomenon.
